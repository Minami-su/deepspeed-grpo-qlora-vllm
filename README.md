# fsdp-grpo-qlora-vllm
This repository provides a complete framework for fine-tuning LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on 4-bit quantized models (QLoRA). It utilizes Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) for scalable training and integrates with a VLLM server to dynamically serve the fine-tuned LoRA adapters.
